When I worked as a freelance web developer back in the early 2000's, there was a common trait that all of my favorite clients had: They were the ones who had an idea, something they weren’t quite sure was possible, but something they felt in their gut was an idea worth pursuing. They were so sure of it, in fact, that they were willing to put their trust in a young web developer to help usher their dream into reality. I’ve missed the excitement of partnering with these visionaries and helping make something that was only an idea into a reality—into a _business_. So that’s what I’m we're doing.

## Mettle

Mettle is a brand new software agency specializing in building robust web and mobile applications. It’s essentially taking the freelance career I put on hold eight years ago to the next level.

Mettle was born in early July after a conversation I had with a friend and fellow coworker at The Salt Mines, Rory Garand. We were discussing my unsure professional future, my dissatisfaction with the direction of my career, and what might come next. He had actually given up his career as an electrical engineer the year before to pursue his own vision of a very specific web application. After spending a year learning the ins and outs of frontend application development using the AngularJS framework and building this application, he was unsure what exactly came next. After an hour or so of commiserating over the future, a thought came to both of us: “Why not team up?”

In the weeks since everything fell into place in an amazing way. We reached out to a few people who were looking for a software partner and almost immediately our schedule was full. I don’t think either of us really knows what Mettle is going to look like in five years—or even five months—but as a starting point we’re working together to help businesses and organizations who need a hand bringing their ideas to fruition.  After that, who knows?

And so beginning on October 21, when I touch down in Europe, Mettle will officially be a transcontinental development studio with offices in Columbus, OH and Prague, Czech Republic. If you know someone who needs a hand making their dream a reality—on whatever continent—we’d love an introduction. Our web site is forthcoming, but you will be able to follow along on Twitter and Facebook.

Here’s to the future, and having the guts to make it what you want it to be.
